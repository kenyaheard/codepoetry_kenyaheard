Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

my lip gloss is poppin'
my lip gloss is kewww
all the boys keep stoppin'
they chase me after school
myyyyyy lip gloss is poppin
